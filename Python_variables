#Creating Variables
#Python has no command for declaring a variable.

#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. 

x = 5
y = "Enes"
print(x)
print(y)

#Casting
#If you want to specify the data type of a variable
x = str(3)   
y = int(3)    
z = float(3)

#Get the Type
#You can get with type() function
x = 16
y = "Enes"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

#Single or Double Quotes?
#When you are creating a string you can use either single quotes or double quotes 
x = "Enes"
print(x)
#double quotes are the same as single quotes:
x = 'Enes'
print(x)

#Case-Sensitive
#In python variable names are case sensitive that means NAME name and Name would all be considered different variables
a = 16
A = "Enes"

print(a)
print(A)

#Variable Names
#A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name 
myvar = "Enes"
my_var = "Enes"
_my_var = "Enes"
myVar = "Enes"
MYVAR = "Enes"
myvar2 = "Enes"


print(myvar)
print(my_var)
print(_my_var)
print(myVar)
print(MYVAR)
print(myvar2)

#Camel Case
#Each word starts with a capital letter
myVariableName = "Enes"
#Pascal Case
#Each word starts with a capital letter
MyVariableName = "Enes"
#Snake Case
#Each word is separated by an underscore character
my_variable_name = "Enes"
